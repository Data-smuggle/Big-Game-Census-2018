# Big-Game-Census-2018
Big Game Census Analysis Project
Overview

This project aims to analyze big game census data through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualize the findings using interactive dashboards in Tableau. The analysis leverages Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and transformation, followed by an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to prepare the data for visualization.

Project Goals

The main objectives of this project are to:

    Conduct EDA to uncover insights from the big game census data.
    Transform and load the cleaned data into Tableau.
    Create interactive dashboards to visualize key metrics and trends.

Technologies Used

    Python: For data manipulation and EDA
        Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
    Tableau: For creating interactive dashboards
    Jupyter Notebook: For documenting the EDA process

Data Sources

    [Link to your dataset or description of the dataset]

Installation

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

    Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/big-game-census-analysis.git
cd big-game-census-analysis

Install required Python packages:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

    jupyter notebook

Usage

    Open the provided Jupyter Notebook (EDA.ipynb) to explore the EDA process.
    Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the analysis.
    After completing the EDA, execute the ETL process to prepare data for Tableau.

ETL Process

The ETL process consists of the following steps:

    Extract: Load the raw census data into a Pandas DataFrame.
    Transform: Clean and preprocess the data:
        Handle missing values
        Normalize data formats
        Create new features as necessary
    Load: Export the cleaned data to a CSV file for Tableau:

    cleaned_data.to_csv('cleaned_big_game_census.csv', index=False)

Results

The final results include:

    Key findings and visualizations generated during the EDA.
    Interactive dashboards in Tableau showcasing trends and insights from the big game census data.

Future Improvements

    Incorporate additional data sources for a more comprehensive analysis.
    Enhance the dashboards with more detailed visualizations.
    Implement advanced analytics techniques such as predictive modeling.
